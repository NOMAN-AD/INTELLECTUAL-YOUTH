  <p>India is a land of potential—but also of paradox. In a country of 140 crore people, we proudly announce startup schemes, youth summits, and digital missions. Yet, the streets echo with a silent crisis: Unemployment.</p>

  <p><strong>But who’s really responsible?</strong></p>

  <p>Let’s stop blaming the population. Let’s start talking about misgovernance.</p>

  <h2>A System Designed to Fail Its Youth</h2>
  <p>Our education system is a 70-year-old blueprint, designed during colonial rule to create clerks—not creators. Today, lakhs of students graduate with degrees but no direction. They memorize, they repeat, they pass. But they don’t build, innovate, or lead. Why?</p>

  <p>Because our system never taught them how.</p>

  <h2>The Business of Taxing Dreams</h2>
  <p>India speaks of entrepreneurship, yet GST policies choke small businesses. Government schemes like Startup India rarely reach ground-level youth. Loans are denied on silly technical grounds. Those who dream of doing something different are often forced into job hunts. And when no jobs remain—they feel like failures.</p>

  <p>But the real failure is of leadership.</p>

  <h2>Media & Politicians: The Great Distraction</h2>
  <p>While youth struggle for employment, media debates temples and tombs.</p>

  <p>From the Ram Mandir to the Waqf Board, from loudspeakers to love jihad—the focus remains on religion, not reality.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, jobless graduates ride dangerous routes like the "Donkey Route" to foreign lands, risking life just to survive.</p>

  <p>Why doesn’t this dominate headlines?</p>

  <h2>Opposition? Missing. Accountability? Absent.</h2>
  <p>Even opposition parties avoid speaking on unemployment. Why?</p>

  <p>Because solving it requires courage, strategy, and real investment—not just slogans during election time.</p>

  <p>Until then, unemployment remains India’s most ignored emergency.</p>

  <h2>What India Needs</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Education Reform:</strong> Teach skills, not just syllabi.</li>
    <li><strong>Startup Support:</strong> Make loans accessible to real innovators.</li>
    <li><strong>Tax Rebalance:</strong> Don’t crush small business with complex GST.</li>
    <li><strong>Media Reform:</strong> Prioritize people, not politics.</li>
    <li><strong>Unity:</strong> Stop religious division. Start national development.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Final Words</h2>
  <p>India doesn’t lack talent.</p>
  <p>India lacks leadership that believes in its youth.</p>
  <p>We don’t need more job seekers.</p>
  <p>We need more job creators—and a system that lets them breathe.</p>
